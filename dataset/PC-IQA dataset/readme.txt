This PC-IQA dataset contains 15 reference images and 15 distorted versions of each reference, for a total of 240 images which come from two publicly available datasets, LIVE and IVC. The distorted images in LIVE dataset are obtained using five different distortion processes ¡ª JPEG2000, JPEG, White Noise, Gaussian Blur, and Fast Fading Rayleigh, while the distorted images in IVC dataset are derived from four distortion types ¡ª JPEG2000, JPEG, LAR Coding, and Blurring. Totally, 186 observers, each of whom performs a varied number of comparisons via Internet, provide 23,097 paired comparisons for subjective IQA.  

If you want to test your method on this dataset, please load the paired comparison data (e.g. data1.mat file contains 4129 paired comparisons for reference image 1).  The first column in data1.mat is the image ID with better quality and the second column is the image ID with worse quality.
